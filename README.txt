# Data_Management_CSC8631

Nhanes 2015/2016 Dataset

Main R Markdown document can be found in the 'src' folder saved as 'Data_Man_Main.Rmd'. 
Some of the actual code can be found within the body of this document including correlations and correlation plot, pie, box and scatter plots, and all the hypothesis testing. This will run and produce the report without the need for any instruction. Deatails of each section can be found within the report.

A Shiny dashboard has been produced to allow the user to interact with this data via box plot, scatter plot and an interactive group proportion table (which runs the prop_func function). This is save in the 'src' folder and named 'Shiny2.R'
In order to run this, open the file, load the 'ui' and 'server' then shinyApp to open up in the browser.

Data wrangling code is saved in the 'munge' folder named 'Wrangling.R'. 
This includes:
- Loading of the dataset
- Renaming of columns into more easily understandable names
- Removing of columns which were not required
- Renaming some of the column values (e.g. 1 and 2 to Male and Female)
- Changing some of the categorical variables from numeric to factor
- Creating an agegroup column


Functions have been saved in the 'lib' folder names 'helpers.R.
The 3 functions are:
corr_func - to quickly work out a correlation
grp_func - Function to take dataset, group_by and analyse variable to output mean, min and max
prop_func - Function that takes the following arguments: data frame, categorical group variable, and binary variable to analyse. Then outputs 
a new data frame of  proportions based on these arguments (split by gender)

The in-built test functions were used to make sure these functions were working correctly. These tests were saved in the 'tests' folder saved as 'autogenerated.R'. All functions passed the tests.

Git log can be found in the main directory (CSC8631_DM_Assignment) saved as '190587802GitLogFile.txt'.
